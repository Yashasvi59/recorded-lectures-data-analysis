# recorded-lectures-data-analysis
This project analyzes EdTech recorded lecture data to uncover category-wise trends, viewer preferences, and content performance, enabling strategic decisions for growth, engagement, and optimized course offerings.


<h4>This project is about helping an EdTech company understand how people engage with recorded online courses. The company collected data from different education websites, and now we’re using that data to find useful insights.</h4>

We’re mainly looking at different categories of courses—like business, technology, design, etc.—to figure out:

----Which types of courses are popular in each category

----How many courses are available in each category and sub-category

----How many views different courses get, and which ones get the most attention

----What languages are most commonly used for these courses

----What skills are being taught the most in each category

----How subtitles and course length affect how many people watch a course

----Which instructors are the best, based on their ratings

----Whether offering more variety in skills helps get more views

All of this will be shown in a dashboard to help the company decide what kind of recorded courses they should create next to attract more learners.
